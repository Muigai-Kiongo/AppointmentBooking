# AppointmentBooking

AppointmentBooking is a web-based booking system designed to help users schedule, manage, and track appointments efficiently. Built with Python for backend logic, HTML for structure, and CSS for styling, this project provides a simple and intuitive interface for both users and administrators.

## Features

- **User Registration & Authentication:** Secure signup and login for users.
- **Appointment Scheduling:** Users can book available slots for appointments.
- **Admin Dashboard:** Administrators can view, approve, or manage appointments.
- **Responsive Interface:** Clean, mobile-friendly design for ease of use.
- **Notifications:** Email or in-app notifications for appointment reminders (if implemented).

## Technology Stack

- **HTML (67.4%)**: Structure and layout of web pages.
- **Python (31.2%)**: Backend logic, routing, and database interactions (likely using Django).
- **CSS (1.4%)**: Styling for web pages.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system
- pip (Python package manager)
- (Optional) Virtual environment tool (venv, virtualenv)
- [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) (required for WeasyPrint on Windows)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Muigai-Kiongo/AppointmentBooking.git
   cd AppointmentBooking
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Python dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Install WeasyPrint dependencies (Windows, using MSYS2):**

   WeasyPrint requires certain libraries that are best installed via MSYS2 on Windows.

   - Download and install [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/).
   - Open the MSYS2 terminal and run:
     ```bash
     pacman -Syu
     pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-python3-pip mingw-w64-x86_64-python3-weasyprint
     pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-cairo mingw-w64-x86_64-pango mingw-w64-x86_64-gdk-pixbuf mingw-w64-x86_64-libffi mingw-w64-x86_64-libxml2 mingw-w64-x86_64-libxslt
     ```
   - If you are running your application from a standard Windows command prompt, you should install [WeasyPrint](https://weasyprint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html) with pip too:
     ```bash
     pip install weasyprint
     ```
   - Ensure your MSYS2 binaries are in your systemâ€™s `PATH`.

5. **Run the application (Django):**
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

### Configuration

- Edit configuration files as needed (e.g., database settings, email server).
- Ensure all environment variables (such as `SECRET_KEY`, database URLs) are set.

## Usage

- Visit the homepage in your browser.
- Register or log in as a user.
- Book, view, or manage appointments.
- If you are an admin, access the dashboard for additional controls.
